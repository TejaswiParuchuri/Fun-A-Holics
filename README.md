## Fun-A-Holics

ðŸ‘‰ In the time of Zoom meetings and Work from Home environment, searching for fun recreational activities (to do nearby with safety precautions or at home) to uplift the mood has become a necessity and we want to build a scalable cloud solution (using PAAS offered by google cloud platform GCP) to address this problem. This application will provide an interactive Web-Interface to help users find recreational activities (indoor and outdoor) based on criteria such as the number of group members, minimum age/maximum age information, budget, location preferences, category of activities, status of event etc. All the effort of filtering the virtual events or outdoor activities suiting their budget and other requirements will be taken care of by the Fun-A-Holics app. This app will help users find recurring events (like online yoga, gaming) created by us even on days when user created events are limited. In case of outdoor events, we have  included COVID test results as a prerequisite. Only those who successfully submit the negative covid testing results or covid vaccination report at the start of the event are eligible to attend the event.
